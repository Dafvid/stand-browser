Stand Browser - forestry in QGIS 
============================================

I have for a long time used QGIS to store and view my forestry
data. For almost as long time, I've been thinking about adapting QGIS
to work better with forestry. There are mainly three areas I would
like to improve:

* Easy viewing of stand data
* Caclulating stand data from observations
* Yearly update of growth

This is the first step.

Data format
===========

The plugin assumes the data is stored in a vector data set. The field names
must follow the description below. It is modelled after how the
Heureka data model of the SLU stores its data.

Usage
=====

In the drop-down menu at the top of the dock window, all available
vector layers that contains the required ``standid`` field are
shown. Select the layer you want to browse here.

Pushing the buttons Next and Prev shows infrormation about the next
and previous stand in the window. If any fields are missing in the
vector layer, it is shown as blank. These buttons also change the
current selection in the layer, and pans/zooms to the newly selected
stand.

If you select - e.g. with the mouse or in the QGIS attribute table -
more than one stand a new set of buttons appear. They are Next
Selected and Prev Selected respectively. Pushing those buttons loops
through the selected stands, but *does not* change the selection.

The yellow background in the ``Stand ID`` field indicates that it is
editable. Writing the name of a stand and hiting return, searches for
that stand and displays it. If no such stand is found, the field is
reset to last valid stand.
